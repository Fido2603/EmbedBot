## How do I use EmbedBot?
Well, EmbedBot is a bot which you need to host yourself, but, fear not! It is not that hard... I hope...
1.  Create a new Bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Save the token.
2.  Invite the bot to the server(s) you are gonna use it on.
3.  Download a copy of EmbedBot.
4.  Copy configExample.json, and rename it to config.json.
5.  Fill out config.json with your Embeds as well as token. The embeds are per. channel.
6.  If you don't have it already, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
7.  Open a terminal in the folder where you have EmbedBot.
8.  Write `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` into the terminal.
9.  After the requirements are installed, run `python bot.py` in the terminal.
10.  Profit?
